likert: non numeric values											//done
scale from 0 to 10: equidistant numerical values, that can be used for computations				//done

shooting test: explicitly link shooting to task environment (quick and precise spatial pointing)		//done

effect size: pearson correlation										//done
p-value significance: 0.01 footnote										//done
	-> talk about significant correlation with strong effect						//done


small sample size: 
title: lower expectations, couple more with actual topic							//done
	-> modify introduction to lower expectations								//done
	->"An Approach on Hand Comfort/Discomfort Quantification"						//done
	-> state that results are noisy, BUT manage to deliver impressing results				//done

user studies: 1 user study for improving, pilot study-> verificating second user study				//done
what is training data, what is testdata?									//done
Add age, gender for each user study										//done

throw out: Figure 7 (naive metric- test data), show cor vals instead						//not needed
add in table with coefficients											//done

naive metric is an extension of the work ... with addition of IFA 						//partially done
improved metric is naive metric differentiating between fingers							//done

bullet points to sentence											//done

what is the naive metric? Throw comfort and discomfort together.						//TODO: explain explicitly in text
	-> unify in one metric											//done
	-> future work: look at comfort and discomfort seperately 						//done

add reference to laviola for figure 2 and 3 									//done

add adduction reference (figure 3) 										//done

changelog:

- high quality vector graphic plots
- added authors
- fixed typos in references
- abstract: "we propose an early, straightforward metric"
- added references for figure 2 and 3
- added reference to figure 3 for first use of adduction
- added explicit names to RRP and HE to make origin clear
- added explanation, why no likert-like scale was used
- added in an explenation, why the target shooting test was chosen
- modified results and discussion, future work to explain data andshow pioneer approach 
- unified comfort and discomfort metric as they create too much uhh...
- added word "short-term" in many cases
- changed description of user studies
- took out justification of hand model, cause nobody cares m8
