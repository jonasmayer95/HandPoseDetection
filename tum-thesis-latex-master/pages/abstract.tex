This bachelor thesis aims to support the creation and evaluation of a hand posture vocabulary for efficient pointing-based posture interaction. For that the aim is to create a hand posture comfort/discomfort metric that allows for quick and objective hand posture evaluation. Furthermore the impact of comfort and discomfort on precision and performance in spacial interaction is to be explored.

Based on state-of-the-art comfort and discomfort models a metric is composed. Furthermore a Unity 3D environment is created that allows to compute the metric in real time and to automate the testing of the metric in form of a user study. 

The results from two user studies show that the proposed metric is adequate for predicting user perceived comfort and discomfort. Furthermore the results indicate that comfort and discomfort as measured by the metric do affect precision and performance.
